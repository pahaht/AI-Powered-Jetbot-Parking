### *Overview*
This project leverages the Jetbot Mini to create an autonomous parking system that uses 
computer vision to display visual indicators. The bot navigates and parks autonomously, 
displaying 'L' shaped lines in green, yellow, and red to indicate different statuses or zones.

### *Features*
Autonomous Navigation: The Jetbot Mini navigates autonomously using sensors and camera inputs.
Visual Indicators: Displays 'L' shaped lines with green, yellow, and red colors to signify different statuses.

-Green: Indicates a safety zone.
-Yellow: Indicates a caution zone.
-Red: Indicates a danger zone.

### *Prerequisites*
Ensure you have the following installed:

   -Python 3.6
   -OpenCV
   -Jetson Nano (for Jetbot Mini)
   -NumPy
   -Jetbot library
